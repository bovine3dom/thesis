This project  is dual-licensed under  the CRAPL and  2-Clause BSD
License (sic). You may choose between  the two. The CRAPL is more
enjoyable to read but is less permissive.

I have  taken the  unusual step of  reformatting the  licences to
avoid  paragraphs  typeset  in  capital letters.  In  my  limited
understanding, but perhaps contrary to popular belief, writing in
all-caps does not add any extra legal weight to any agreement.

THE CRAPL v0 BETA 1


0. Information about the CRAPL

If you  have questions or concerns  about the CRAPL, or  you need
more information about this license, please contact:

I. Preamble

Science thrives on openness.

In modern  science, it  is often  infeasible to  replicate claims
without access to the software underlying those claims.

Let's all be  honest: when scientists write  code, aesthetics and
software  engineering  principles  take  a back  seat  to  having
running, working code before a deadline.

So, let's release the ugly. And, let's be proud of that.


II. Definitions

1. "This  License" refers to  version 0  beta 1 of  the Community
Research and Academic Programming License (the CRAPL).

2.  "The Program"  refers to  the  medley of  source code,  shell
scripts, executables, objects, libraries and build files supplied
to You, or these files as modified by You.

   [Any   appearance  of   design  in   the  Program   is  purely
coincidental and should  not in any way be  mistaken for evidence
of thoughtful software construction.]

3. "You" refers to the person or persons brave and daft enough to
use the Program.

4. "The Documentation" refers to the Program.

5. "The  Author" probably refers to  the caffeine-addled graduate
student that got the Program  to work moments before a submission
deadline.


III. Terms

1. By  reading this sentence,  You have  agreed to the  terms and
conditions of this License.

2.  If the  Program shows  any evidence  of having  been properly
tested or verified, You will disregard this evidence.

3. You agree to hold the Author free from shame, embarrassment or
ridicule for  any hacks, kludges  or leaps of faith  found within
the Program.

4. You  recognize that  any request for  support for  the Program
will be discarded with extreme prejudice.

5. The Author reserves all rights  to the Program, except for any
rights  granted under  any  additional licenses  attached to  the
Program.


IV. Permissions

1. You  are permitted  to use the  Program to  validate published
scientific claims.

2. You  are permitted to  use the Program to  validate scientific
claims submitted  for peer review,  under the condition  that You
keep modifications to the Program confidential until those claims
have been published.

3. You  are permitted to  use and/or  modify the Program  for the
validation of  novel scientific claims  if You make  a good-faith
attempt to notify  the Author of Your work and  Your claims prior
to submission for publication.

4. If You publicly release any claims or data that were supported
or generated by  the Program or a modification  thereof, in whole
or in part,  You will release any inputs supplied  to the Program
and any modifications  You made to the Progam.  This License will
be in effect for the modified program.


V. Disclaimer of Warranty

There is no warranty for the  program, to the extent permitted by
applicable  law.  Except when  otherwise  stated  in writing  the
copyright  holders  and/or  other  parties  provide  the  program
"as  is"  without  warranty  of any  kind,  either  expressed  or
implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of
merchantability and fitness for  a particular purpose. The entire
risk as  to the quality  and performance  of the program  is with
you. should the  program prove defective, you assume  the cost of
all necessary servicing, repair or correction.


VI. Limitation of Liability

In no  event unless required  by applicable  law or agreed  to in
writing  will  any  copyright  holder, or  any  other  party  who
modifies and/or conveys the program as permitted above, be liable
to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or
consequential damages arising out of  the use or inability to use
the program  (including but not limited  to loss of data  or data
being rendered  inaccurate or  losses sustained  by you  or third
parties or  a failure of  the program  to operate with  any other
programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of
the possibility of such damages.
