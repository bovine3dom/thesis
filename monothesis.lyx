Complex networks appear everywhere in the world.
 They describe everything from the Internet and transport networks to neuronal
 networks and social networks.
 Characterising these networks—that is, describing them quantitatively—is
 vitally important to understanding them, comparing them and tracking their
 temporal evolution.
 The connection patterns, or topologies, of networks are often very different
 across different networks and sometimes even between different parts of
 a single network, or over time in temporal networks.
 This work focuses particularly on these connection patterns and how they
 can characterise networks at multiple scales: we use the topology to characteri
se nodes, communities and entire networks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the subject of node characterisation, we demonstrate the merits of using
 colour in graphlet profiles when characterising ego-networks, using this
 technique to discover that, in scientific co-authorship networks, the proportio
n of graphlets of a specific kind centred on an author early in their career
 is correlated with that author's final academic career length.
 These graphlets which are correlated with career length are 4-stars; induced
 subgraphs containing four nodes where one node is the author and the other
 three nodes only have a link to the author.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For whole-network characterisation, we use matrix decomposition of data
 matrices formed from topological properties such as degree-mixing matrices
 and graphlet profiles to clearly distinguish between real networks and
 network models and track changes in networks over time.
 We introduce the term 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

piecewise static networks
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 to describe the application of standard static network analysis to temporal
 networks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, on community characterisation, we introduce a new way of assessing
 the goodness-of-fit for tensor decompositions of temporal networks by applying
 adjusted mutual information and employ this technique to throw more light
 on software dependency networks—where we use it to highlight the uniqueness
 of the R language's software package ecosystem due to R's

 And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn.
 It's shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and
 how many more believe learning to be difficult.

 Tara, keep chasing whatever makes you happy, whether that's ecology, field
 sites, or your daughter Eilah! I'm equal parts sorry and glad that the
 experimental work for thesis was a little less involved than your chasing
 primates across the Congo.
 Eilah, I can't wait to see what you do.
 Dad: this thesis is really for you.

 all around us.
 They characterise the Internet, social networks, patterns of brain activity,
 transport systems and financial networks that define our lives.
 Humanity often meddles with these networks, for example in transportation
 networks where we add traffic lights to control traffic, financial networks
 where politicians suggest transaction taxes and social networks where parents
 try to send their children to a good school in the hope that they will
 be influenced in a good way by friends.
 But we only have a shallow understanding of how these networks work.
 Surprising (and controversial!) results are still published in this very
 young field

.
 It is our hope that the new tools this thesis provides will be used to
 further this understanding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis is particularly concerned with ways of characterising networks
 and parts of networks, i.e.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

developing ways of comparing and distinguishing networks or parts of networks,
 from looking at their topologies, or wiring patterns.
 This topological approach is attractive as the wiring patterns of real-world
 networks often change at a much slower rate than the dynamics on those
 networks; for example, the amount of road-traffic changes with the time
 of day but new roads take years to build 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gross_adaptive_2009"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The connections between parts of a system are often fairly easy to observe
 compared to the equations governing the dynamics—it is far easier to observe
 where a road leads than it is to understand exactly what caused a driver
 to pick that road, for example.
 Data on wiring patterns are therefore often more readily available than
 they are for node dynamics.
 We take a multi-scale approach where we consider characterisation of complex
 networks at three scales: at the scale of nodes, communities and whole
 networks.

This first part serves as an introduction to the thesis.
 The first chapter presents a brief introduction to network science and
 the characterisation of networks; the next chapter is a more rigorous and
 mathematically-involved primer on the background of this thesis and the
 state-of-the-art of characterisation in network science and related techniques.

A short history of graph theory and network science 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The seven bridges of Königsberg
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Königsberg, now known as Kaliningrad, is a beautiful Baltic city.
 There are two islands in the centre of the city (see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Kaliningrad"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) which historically had seven bridges connecting them.
 The question whether it was possible to walk across each bridge exactly
 once required new techniques.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "euler1741"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 proved the walk was impossible, laying the foundations for graph theory
 along the way.
 He noticed that the topology, what we would now call a multigraph, was
 key to solving the problem: once you represent each bank or island as a
 node, with the bridges between them as links, it follows that, for a node
 which one is not currently on, in order to cross each link exactly once
 and not become stuck on the node, there must be an even number of links
 going to it, which we call an even degree (nodes at which one starts or
 ends the path must have odd degrees for the opposite reason).
 However, all of the nodes in the network have odd degree, as can be seen
 in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Kaliningrad"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, and so the walk was not possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two bridges were lost in the bombing of Königsberg in World War II, along
 with most of the historic city centre, a tragedy compounded about a year
 later by the Soviet expulsion of the native population.
 However, the destruction of the two bridges does at least mean that one
 can enjoy walks crossing each bridge once, as the two banks of the river
 now have even degrees and the islands have odd degrees.

\begin_layout Subsection
Random graphs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the interests of brevity, we now skip over 200 years of fascinating results
 from graph theory to 1959, when 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeauthor
key "Erdos1959"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 first proposed a model of random graphs.
 Their model, explored in more depth in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Network-models"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, was the first to be used to rigorously explore what it meant for a graph
 to have randomness.
 They showed that random graphs are very likely to be totally connected
 (i.e.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

a route is possible between every pair of nodes) with a relatively low number
 of edges and that the average distance between randomly chosen nodes grows
 very slowly with the total number of nodes.
 This decoupling of the distance between nodes and the total number of nodes
 is a key feature of real world networks and allows information to cross
 networks very quickly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Small-world networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These random graphs captured an important property of real-world networks:
 the average distance, or path length, between nodes is often short.
 This has been known intuitively for a very long time:

\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 has been a common refrain when one finds that a stranger has a mutual friend
 for at least a hundred years.
 This well-known phenomenon was first proved by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "milgram1967small"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 in a famous experiment where he gave addressed letters out at random to
 people who were instructed to either send the letter to the addressee directly
 if they knew them personally, or forward the letter to the person they
 thought was most likely to know the addressee.
 Milgram's results are shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SW"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

: the modal number of intermediaries used was six, so the modal path length
 was seven.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a problem with the random graphs introduced by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, however.
 It is unlikely that linked nodes share neighbours, a property often found
 in real networks; in the jargon of the field, they have a very low 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

clustering coefficient
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

, whereas real networks often have a high clustering coefficient.

 as cliques interacting across weak (e.g.

 developed a model based on these ideas: a nearest neighbour ring network
 with weak-ties thrown in at random.
 They showed that a network needs very few of these weak ties before the
 path length loses direct proportionality with the number of nodes; this
 slow growth in path length is the small-world effect.

It was soon found that many real-world networks had degree distributions
 that looked nothing like the small-world or random graphs; 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "barabasi1999emergence"

\end_inset

 found that real-world degree distributions often had 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

fat tails
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 with a few nodes having the lion's share of the links.
 They proposed a model of preferential attachment—that new nodes added to
 a network tend to link to nodes with high degree—which resulted in networks
 with degree distributions which followed a power-law, as they had observed
 in real networks.
 There has been some recent controversy over suggestions that these are
 perhaps less common than was previously thought if one uses a very strict
 definition of what it means to follow a power-law

 formalised the intuitive idea that the local structures of networks were
 essential to their function.
 They devised a method of calculating how unusual a local structure was—i.e.
 how unlikely it was to appear by chance—and used this to extract small
 graphs characteristic of graphs from several categories, including the
 Internet, food webs and gene regulatory networks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Characterisation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Characterisation is key to many areas of life.
 When we purchase a car, we want to know what colour it is, how much it
 costs, how fast it goes, how much fuel it consumes and whether we can fit
 the shopping in the boot; when purchasing a house we want to know how often
 it floods, how much the asking price is and how close it is to a school.
 We use these characteristics to categorise things: if it goes fast and
 I can't fit my shopping in the boot, it's a sports car; if it was alive
 in the cretaceous period and looks like a giant lizard, I'm calling it
 a dinosaur.
 Characterisation's innate attraction is evident by the success of the 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

Top Trumps
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 series of card games where one holds fact-sheets for examples of things
 within a certain field, be it sports cars, dinosaurs or Star Wars.
 This desire to categorise and compare is part of being human.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps the most famous and successful example of using characterisation
 to more deeply understand part of our universe are Hertzsprung-Russell
 diagrams 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Russell1914"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, an example of which is shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:A-Hertzsprung-Russell-diagram"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 By simply plotting the luminosity (total power radiated) against the surface
 temperature or colour (which are directly related) for observed stars,
 a striking pattern emerges and, with a little interpretation and background
 knowledge, the various paths a star may take throughout its life become
 clear.
 All stars start following the 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

main sequence
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 in the top left, becoming redder as they age.
 Massive stars become 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

giants
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 while smaller stars stay on the main sequence.
 Our ultimate goal is to make advances like this possible in the field of
 network science.

The Kronecker product is a binary operator,

\begin_inset Formula

Degree
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The degree of a node in a network is the number of edges connected to the
 node.
 It is calculated as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}a_{i\leftarrow j}\text{.}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the network is directed (i.e.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $A\neq A^{\intercal}$
\end_inset

), each node has an in-degree, 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{\text{in}}$
\end_inset

, and out-degree, 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{\text{out}}$
\end_inset

, showing the number of inbound and outbound links respectively.
 Intuitively, the first moment of these is identical, 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{k^{\text{in}}}=\overline{k^{\text{out}}}=\overline{k}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\overline{k^{\text{in}}} & =\frac{\text{sum of all in-degrees}}{\text{number of nodes}}=\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N}k_{j}^{\text{in}}}{N}=\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N}(\sum_{i=1}^{N}a_{i\leftarrow j})}{N}\\
\overline{k^{\text{out}}} & =\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}k_{i}^{\text{out}}}{N}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\sum_{j=1}^{N}a_{i\leftarrow j})}{N}=\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}a_{i\leftarrow j}}{N}=\overline{k^{\text{in}}}=\overline{k}\text{,}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

so one often refers just to the

1 & \text{if there is an edge from node }j\text{ to node }i\\
0 & \text{otherwise.}

In a weighted network, the values correspond to the weights of the links
 which may be any real numbers (rather than just unity or zero); if

Tensor decomposition

\begin_layout Standard
Tensor decompositions can be seen as an extension of matrix decompositions:
 matrix decompositions factorise a matrix into a product of matrices; tensor
 decompositions factorise a tensor into a tensor product of tensors.
 In this work, we choose to decompose tensors into the tensor product of
 rank-1 tensors (i.e.
 vectors).
 A order-
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 can be represented as

\begin_inset Formula

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

where

\end_inset

 is the tensor product

 and each 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{a}_{nr}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{n}}$

\end_inset

 is the dimension of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{\text{th}}$
\end_inset

-mode of the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 If a smaller 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 than is necessary is chosen, the decomposition becomes an approximation.
 When an order 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 tensor is decomposed into 
\begin_inset Formula $RN$
\end_inset

 vectors, the total number of dimensions changes from 
\begin_inset Formula $\prod_{n=1}^{N}d_{n}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{r=1}^{R}\sum_{n=1}^{N}d_{n}$
\end_inset

, which in all sane applications will be smaller.

\begin_layout Standard
To find the tensor decomposition of a tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $X$

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lVert X-\sum_{r=1}^{R}\text{reduce}_{n=1}^{N}(\otimes,\boldsymbol{a}_{nr})\rVert_{F}\text{,}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{a}_{nr}$
\end_inset

 are parameters to be found (
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is generally chosen from domain knowledge).
 The most common way to approach this is to use an alternating least squares
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature

ALS) method where one optimises for a single component at a time using least
 squares, holding all other components fixed, and then iterating through
 each component repeatedly until convergence

 For our applications, we impose a further constraint such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

Average path length
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The path length between two nodes is the length of the route taken between
 the two nodes.
 For an unweighted network, this is the number of edges such a path would
 touch; for a weighted network it would be the sum of the weights of those
 edges.
 The shortest, or geodesic, path length is the shortest possible route between
 two nodes; often this is just abbreviated to

However, our view is that these authors have somewhat missed the point of
 PCA: it can be used for feature selection and extraction, i.e.
\begin_inset space \space{}

an unbiased selection of the best features to explain the variance in some
 data.
 In our view, one should therefore aim to give PCA the highest-dimensional
 representation of the data that can be reasonably found so that it may
 choose the best features itself.
 Instead, the authors cited have fed PCA a selection of

Of these, tensor factorisation has a number of advantages.
 It is a kind of soft clustering, where nodes have membership strengths
 to multiple communities, and so it lends itself naturally to situations
 where nodes are in multiple communities or community membership is not

 It can deal with clustering across multilayer networks and is especially
 useful at characterising the communities of temporal networks, where it

\begin_layout Standard
We do not consider the characterisation of edges in this thesis, but we
 mention it here for completeness.
 Edges share many similarities with nodes: edge betweenness centrality follows
 readily from node betweenness centrality and the ego-network of an edge
 can be defined with ease.
 Other more exotic measures have been explored, such as those based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

-path centrality, an extension of betweenness centrality to

\begin_layout Standard
Complex networks are large networks with non-trivial topologies: e.g.
 with degree mixing matrices that exhibit assortativity or disassortativity,
 community structure where there are groups of nodes within which nodes
 more densely linked to each other than outside the groups, and average
 path lengths that are not functions of the number of nodes in the network,
 or at most, grow very slowly with the number of nodes in the network.
 A complex networked system consists of many interacting agents that communicate
 with each other over a web of complex interconnections.
 In the formalism of network science, the agents, or 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

things
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

, are called nodes, which are connected together by links or edges; other
 formalisms such as multi-agent systems could be applied but are not explored
 in this work.

\begin_layout Subsection
Dynamics (of topology)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Complex networks are often formed by dynamical processes; they grow and
 change over time.
 Complex networks are generally created by many agents making small decisions,
 such as websites choosing which other websites to link to, or people choosing
 which other people to send emails to, or neurons making links with nearby
 neurons.

 the topology—for example, in a social network, each person could be considered

 This is not something we have room to consider explicitly in this work,
 although it is of course considered implicitly in many chapters where we
 consider the real-world characteristics of nodes and theorise about how
 the topology might affect these characteristics.

Dealing with real-world networks poses a number of issues, such as being
 inflexible in the number of nodes there are or poor labelling.
 Network models are convenient for the generation of synthetic networks

A random network is created by choosing a random subset of all of the possible

 The links are each present with some probability,

It should be noted that Erdős and Rényi originally formulated their model
 with a number of nodes and a number of edges as its parameters.
 This is equivalent to having an edge probability which we feel captures
 a more important aspect of the model.

 This type of network was first introduced by

 of all research into complex networks, as they were the first people to
 consider large, random networks, as opposed to the traditional, regular
 graphs that were studied before.
 These networks have many interesting properties, such as the sudden appearance
 of a giant component which contains a large fraction of the nodes as

 is increased.

A small-world network is one whose average path length, 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

, grows with the network such that 
\begin_inset Formula $L\propto\log N$
\end_inset

, whilst maintaining a high clustering coefficient.
 The first people to propose a model that could generate such a network
 were 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "watts_collective_1998"

\end_inset

, whose network starts out as a nearest-neighbour ring network.
 Then, a random shortcut is created from each node with a set probability.
 This then also has three parameters: 
\begin_inset Formula $G(n,p,m)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the number of nodes, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the probability of each edge being rewired a random node and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is the initial degree of the nodes.
 These networks are called small-world because their path efficiencies are
 much greater than the corresponding nearest-neighbour network.

 They are called scale-free because their degree distributions look the
 same at different scales—e.g.
 if one takes the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-core of a scale-free network, that is, a subgraph where every node has
 at least degree 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, the resultant network is also a scale-free network.
 The most famous model of these networks, and the only scale-free model
 we consider in this work, is the Barabási-Albert model.
 This model grows a network from 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 unconnected nodes.
 Nodes are added and connected to 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 pre-existing nodes chosen with probability proportional to the degree of
 those nodes.
 These models therefore have two main parameters: 
\begin_inset Formula $G(n,m)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the number of nodes and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is the number of links to add with each node.

One of the main challenges with real-world co-authorship networks is disambiguat
ion: the ability to identify when two authors with the same name are different
 people.
 Datasets exist where this procedure has been completed

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As with other temporal networks made from data where events are recorded
 as instantaneous but in reality have some unknown duration, a window size
 must be chosen for which the events are extended.
 For example, a 3-year window size means that a co-authorship registered
 in a certain year is extended to also include the two years before it;
 many collaboration network datasets effectively set the window size to
 infinity and consider the network as if it were static.
 This author's own co-authorship network is shown in figure

\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{\text{reduced}}$
\end_inset

 coefficients, the coefficients multiplied by the standard deviation of
 each explanatory variable, are often reported to ease interpretation of
 the coefficients.
 Each reduced coefficient corresponds to the change in the dependent variable
 one could reasonably expect as a result of increasing the corresponding
 explanatory variable from a figure representative of the samples with a
 low amount of that variable, to a figure representative of samples with
 a high amount of that variable.

\begin_layout Subsection
Statistical significance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When sampling data from a population—i.e.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

choosing a subset of that population—and performing an experiment on that
 sample, it is possible that any conclusions drawn from that sample are
 simply due to the composition of the sample and are not representative
 of the population as a whole.
 For example, assume we have a population represented by a matrix
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P=[p_{ij}]=[\delta_{ij}]\text{,}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is the Kronecker delta, and we happen to sample the diagonal of the matrix.
 We would be led to believe that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ij}=1$
\end_inset

.
 Statistical significance tests aim to quantify the likelihood of us being
 misled in such a manner 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fisher1925statistical"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 More rigorously, a statistical significance test calculates the probability
 that an experiment would give a result at least as extreme at the one received
 given that the null hypothesis is true; this probability is called the
 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

p-value
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

.
 The null hypothesis will vary according to the experiment performed but
 generally corresponds to a 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

negative
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 result.
 For example, if we propose that two variables are linked such that 
\begin_inset Formula $y=\beta x+c$
\end_inset

, the null hypothesis is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=0$
\end_inset

, that there is no link.
 One generally chooses a threshold for the p-value
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
p-value
\end_layout

\end_inset

 below which results are accepted or rejected; such a value is called the
 significance level.
 A significance level of 
\begin_inset ERT

The significance levels mentioned above are only valid in the context of
 a single, isolated, hypothesis test (where the null hypothesis is that
 the coefficient is zero).
 Testing many hypotheses simultaneously, for example with a multilinear
 regression, greatly increases the probability of false positives.
 We therefore apply a Bonferroni correction

 supports coloured graphlets.
 However, FANMOD is far from the state-of-the-art in graphlet enumeration;
 it is many times slower than more modern routines

 to tally graphlets by their automorphism group.
 Nauty has built-in support for graph colour.
 There are other graphlet enumeration routines which are quicker for monochromat

, but adapting these for coloured graphs seemed like a far larger undertaking.
 It was therefore decided that adapting Kavosh to work with coloured graphs
 struck a good balance between being a useful contribution to the field
 and the amount of time required to design and build.
 In our testing, the original Kavosh implementation suffered from memory
 leaks.
 As the algorithm is quite short, we re-implemented it from scratch in Julia,
 which required a number of changes which we will enumerate in this chapter.

\begin_layout Subsection
Calling nauty from Julia

\begin_layout Subsection
Limitations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our implementation of Kavosh only supports graphlets of at least size two
 and graphs 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{G}=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$
\end_inset

 with a maximum of two colours, i.e.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
here we use the notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\{i:i\in S\}\equiv\{i\mid i\in S\}$
\end_inset

 to prevent ambiguity with the cardinality of a set
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\lvert\{\pi(i):i\in\mathcal{V}\}\rvert=2$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi(i)$
\end_inset

 is the colour of the node 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 One of these colours must have a maximum of one node, that is, if we let
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi=\{\pi(i):i\in\mathcal{V}\}$
\end_inset

, then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{min}(\{\lvert\{i:\pi(i)=a\}\rvert:a\in\Pi\})\leq1\text{.}
\]

\end_inset

This limitation is because nauty has no memory of the entire graph and so
 it cannot tell the difference, for example, between a red node connected
 to a green node and a yellow node connected to a blue node on separate
 calls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Support for all coloured graphs could be added by adding a new disconnected
 node of each colour to every subgraph as it is sent to nauty acting as
 a key.
 This was not necessary to distinguish between the single ego

 the location of the node of interest within its local topology.
 Our coloured graphlet profiles offer a clear way to retain this information
 from the employment of coloured

ego-networks, where the ego

\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout

, as the location of the node of interest (the ego) is denoted by its colour.

 the ego is one colour and the alters are another, for each size of graphlet
 considered

e that node; these vectors can then be used in further analysis such as

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have described a technique for characterising nodes and networks from
 coloured graphlet profiles, extending previous monochromatic treatments.
 We will employ it in part 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "part:Matrix-decomposition"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 as part of a data matrix to characterise whole networks.
 In the next chapter, we demonstrate its usefulness compared to previous
 monochromatic treatments and the standard node centralities in one example
 application on a real-world piecewise static network.

 their temporal collaboration networks.
 We compare our success with simpler metrics; we find that the use of coloured
 graphlets improves predictive performance compared to colour-blind graphlets;
 that 4-star graphlets centred on an author early in their career are predictors
 of an eventual long career; and that this effect is not degenerate to centralit
ies, i.e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

graphlets have a contribution to career length which is not explained by
 other centralities.

The research lifetime of researchers, that is, the number of years they

 This allows us to disregard degenerate features.
 Our features consist of graphlet profile

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 We chose to consider the 3-ego-networks of each node, where 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the maximum distance from the node of interest.
 Three was chosen as it was found that any more than three did not improve
 predictions and led to somewhat increased computational complexity, considerabl
y so in the worst cases; fewer than three would have meant that some 4-graphlets
 were underrepresented.

The graphlet profiles are calculated as in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:From-graphlet-profiles"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 with the following caveat: we produce coloured and uncoloured graphlet
 profiles and compare them; we refer to them as the coloured and uncoloured
 or monochromatic treatments.
 Monochromatic graphlets can appear in both types of profile but we refer
 to them with a trailing 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

a
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 in the coloured treatment to signify that they represent the complete absence
 of the ego.
 Since we use the graphlet profile as part of multilinear regression, we
 in effect compare the graphlets from each ego-network with every other
 ego-network to determine what is out of the ordinary and what is normal,
 further suggesting that our choice of normalisation in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 agreement with previous studies such as

 We refer to all of the features that are not graphlet profiles as the

 as they characterise graphs rather than nodes.
 However, because we are using them to describe the ego-network of specific
 nodes, they can in some sense be considered to characterise those nodes,
 so we take the liberty of referring to them as centralities.

The data were cleaned in order to consider researchers for whom we have
 a full picture of their careers.
 Any researchers who were active in the first year of the dataset were removed
 to exclude researchers who started their careers before the data began
 and any researchers still active at the end of the dataset, with the assumption
 that these researchers may not have finished their careers yet, were also
 removed.
 This eliminated approximately

 make prediction easier with stronger correlations, leaving us with about

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, it can be seen that these are the graphlets where the ego is central and
 of higher degree than its neighbours.
 Contrary to what one might expect, 4.2b and 3.1b, the all-to-all graphlets
 which in some sense correspond to 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

maximum collaboration
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

, have a very weak negative correlation with lifetime.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the whole, the uncoloured treatment has weaker correlations with lifetime
 and misses out on some subtlety: where monochrome graphlets have equivalent
 coloured graphlets that are both negatively and positively correlated with
 lifetime, the net effect is to have an overall correlation which is closer
 to zero, which could be misleading.
 This is especially evident with graphlet 4.3: 4.3b is one of the strongest
 positive predictors of lifetime, but 4.3a is negatively correlated in the
 coloured treatment, albeit not significantly so.
 This leads to 4.3 having no overall correlation with lifetime in the uncoloured
 treatment, which could explain why previous work found this graphlet to
 be unremarkable (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, where our 4.3 graphlet corresponds to their 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

Motif 3
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The higher correlation with lifetime for 3.2c and 4.3b could be because they
 are proxies for the number of papers published; 4.5c could be a proxy for
 the number of papers published by your collaborators.
 The fact that the correlation is stronger than that of degree centrality
 could be because degree centrality is a poor measure of the number of papers
 published in a co-authorship network; the negative correlation of the clusterin
g coefficients is further evidence in favour of this as a higher number
 of authors per paper will result in a higher clustering coefficient.

To investigate whether graphlet profiles add any new insight compared to
 the standard node centralities, pairwise correlation analysis on the graphlet
 profile components and the centralities was performed, as shown in figure

.
 It can be seen that the monochromatic graphlets 4.5a, 4.3a, 4.6a, 3.2a and
 2.1a are closely related, which is as expected as they are all subgraphs
 of 4.6a.
 Of particular interest is the that graphlets which correlate with lifetime
 also correlate with the various centralities: 4.3b, 4.5c, 4.6b and 3.2c all
 correlate strongly with betweenness centrality.
 Generally, this correlation plot was unsurprising and confirmed the need
 for further analysis to rule out degeneracies.

% Our results are shown in Fig~

ref{fig:importantgraphlets}: various correlation measures are given for
 the metrics compared to researcher lifetime.
 While there are no strong correlations, betweenness centrality, degree,
 clustering and the graphlet frequencies are the least weak.
 The negative correlation with clustering is somewhat surprising and could
 warrant further investigation---it suggests that the efficiency of the
 number of papers per co-author could be important.

Due to the high pairwise correlations between some of the centralities and
 the graphlets that were most highly correlated with lifetime, we tested
 for degeneracy amongst the features by performing linear regression analysis.
 The results can be seen in table

Graphlet profile components with particularly insignificant results have
 been omitted for brevity.
 Many of the most strongly correlated graphlets with lifetime, 4.5c, 3.2c
 and 4.6b, were found to be degenerate to betweenness centrality.
 It can be seen that many of the centralities are much more significant

 The large coefficient suggests that the graphlet's presence could explain
 a large amount of research lifetime, which could warrant further investigation.
 There are no other graphlets which are significantly linked to lifetime.

 This distinction could be because that previous work looked at motifs (i.e,
 all subgraphs, not just induced ones), but one would expect to see the
 4.2 and 4.4 graphlets, of which 4.1 is a subgraph, correlating positively
 with lifetime with some certainty, which is not the case.
 4.2 seems to be negatively correlated with lifetime, if at all.

Finally, it is pertinent to note that none of the features tested have a
 very large impact on career-length, especially when considering the reduced
 coefficients, suggesting that there is a large element of random chance,
 or that some important factor has been left out of our analysis, which
 is consistent with other work

 We have demonstrated that coloured graphlet profiles can be predictors
 for a real-world characteristic of nodes and this predictive power is not
 explained by the other standard centralities; particularly, degree centrality
 and betweenness centrality.

\begin_layout Standard
In our application, the 4.3b graphlet, the 4-star centred on the author of
 interest, was found to be the strongest predictor of career length in researche
rs in the fifth year of their career.
 Therefore, the best advice we can give to young researchers is that they
 should try to collaborate broadly with people who do not collaborate with
 each other.
 However, the correlations we have found do come with the usual caveat:
 there could be some other confounding variables that are at play—for example,
 it could be that the kind of people who collaborate with lots of people
 are interdisciplinarians who are particularly intelligent and therefore
 were more likely to be successful anyway, or that the success of the 4.3b
 graphlet compared to degree centrality could be because 4.3b requires more
 papers to be published than degree centrality; indeed, other work has found
 that the number of papers published is one of the main factors in determining
 career-length 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Milojevic2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This could be solved by a more thorough study with more information about
 each author.
 It could also be beneficial to use a dataset spanning more time as our
 current approach limits the maximum career length to 23 years—we are forced
 disregard any researcher with a career longer than that in order to ensure
 that we have a complete picture of all the careers of the researchers we
 consider.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, it would be interesting to see if our technique has similar or
 greater success in other applications.
 Analysis of any network where there are interesting properties on the nodes
 which are linked to the medium scale structure of the network could plausibly
 benefit; for example, it could be used to detect groups of users on a social
 network spreading information in an inauthentic fashion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our main conclusion is that when characterising a node through its ego-network,
 it can be useful to retain the information as to which node is the ego
 and which are the alters.
 This information can be used by existing graph packages by colouring the
 ego one colour and the alters another.

The standard form for high-dimensional representations of observations is
 the data matrix.
 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

Data matrix
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 is a term from the field of machine learning which we adopt; each column
 is termed a

feature
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 and each row is called an 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

example
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

.
 In our application, each example corresponds to a network.
 Each feature is an observable property of a network which is directly comparabl
e across all networks considered; for example, one feature might be 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

first moment of the degree distribution
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 and another might be 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

network diameter
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

.
 The creation of data matrices allows us to easily apply standard techniques
 from other fields to characterise networks, as was explored by previous
 work 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Costa2007,bounova_overview_2012,Ronqui2015"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, as was discussed in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Matrix-decompositions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, these previous works used existing metrics as features which we believe
 is somewhat against the spirit of machine learning; one should apply it
 to the fullest representation of the data possible and allow the technique
 to discover which features are the most important.
 In this chapter, we explore how we can provide high-dimensional descriptions
 of networks to these data matrices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Requirements for data matrix
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each feature in the data matrix must be directly comparable between examples;
 if two examples have the same entry for a feature, it must mean that this
 observable property is in some way the same.
 An additional constraint is that all of the features must have physical
 dimensions consistent with the transformation applied by the machine learning
 techniques used; for example, a linear transformation demands that the
 features must have the same physical dimensions, because the addition of
 features must be a valid operation.
 We normalise our features to make them dimensionless.
 It is important to note that there is often no penalty to including features
 that do not provide discriminatory power, as the machine learning procedures
 will just discard them.
 Clearly, some features must have some discriminatory power for the procedure
 to provide anything useful.
 In this and the next chapter, we consider the features separately such
 that we can understand their usefulness separately.
 In a real application one would concatenate all of the relevant feature
 vectors into a single feature vector, which could increase the richness
 of the results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Features considered
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we present a series of metrics and network representations
 and discuss whether they meet our criteria for features.
 In addition to the absolute requirements mentioned above, a good feature
 should also have the following properties:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
similar networks should have small Euclidean distances between one another,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
dissimilar networks, such as configuration models and the original networks,
 should have a fairly large distance between one another,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
invariance with respect to the number of nodes in the graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our view, as was discussed in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Matrix-decompositions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, features should also be simple—each feature should have as little 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

human design
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 in it as possible to allow the machine learning technique to make its own
 decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All matrices are converted into feature vectors by simply flattening them
 such that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{i+(j-1)n}=a_{ij}\text{,}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{x}$
\end_inset

 is the feature vector corresponding to the 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times m$
\end_inset

 matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Adjacency matrices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adjacency matrices
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 do not initially appear to satisfy the requirements on features: there
 is no guarantee that node labels (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\{i|v_{i}\in\mathcal{V}\}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in\mathbb{N\setminus}\{0\}$
\end_inset

) between different graphs have the same meaning.
 We therefore relabel the nodes such that the node with the lowest degree
 has the lowest label and the node with the highest degree has the highest
 label; any nodes with the same degree are labelled randomly.
 This does mean that only networks with the same number of nodes can be
 meaningfully considered, even with padding—the decomposition would otherwise
 spot the hard cut-off as small networks had empty entries for any node
 labels higher than their number of nodes.
 It is unclear whether similar networks will have small distances between
 each other, nor whether dissimilar networks will have large distances between
 each other.
 This is something we will determine in testing in the next chapter.
 The feature is, however, very simple—it is the most common representation
 of networks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We note with interest that node labels in synthetic graphs often hold a
 great deal of meaning.
 In many implementations of Watts-Strogatz small-world networks, nodes with
 adjacent or near-adjacent labels are neighbours and so have a far greater
 probability of being linked than nodes with labels which are very far apart.
 Similarly, Barabási-Albert models are usually constructed such that nodes
 with lower labels have higher degrees than nodes with higher labels as
 the first nodes added to the network are most likely to have links added
 to them.
 It is therefore very easy to be misled by the quality of these matrices;
 one receives very good separation between separate models due to the wealth
 of information contained in their labels.
 This information is clearly not 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 in the sense that one is generally unable to construct a real network with
 labels which are as useful as that, so we take great care to discard it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout
network representations!Laplacian matrix
\end_layout

\end_inset

Laplacian matrices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Laplacian matrices, similar to adjacency matrices, do not appear to satisfy
 the requirements on features as node labels are not directly comparable.
 Relabelling the nodes based on their degree mitigates this.
 Since we only consider networks with no self-loops, the Laplacian as a
 feature vector is clearly equivalent to including the degree sequence at
 the end of the adjacency matrix.
 As such, the Laplacian matrix adheres to our criteria in the same way as
 the adjacency matrices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Degree correlation matrices

\begin_layout Standard
The degree mixing matrix or degree correlation matrix
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

, is defined such that each entry
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d_{i\leftarrow j}=P(\text{edge chosen at random connects a node of degree }j\text{ to a node of degree }i)\text{.}
\]

\end_inset

As it is a joint probability distribution, it is already normalised and
 suitable for usage with networks of any number of nodes.
 The degree mixing matrices are quick to calculate and take relatively little
 memory as, for most real-world networks, the maximum degree in a network
 grows very slowly with the size of the network.
 Networks with the same degree correlations will appear closely together;
 whether this is a good measure of similarity is an open question.
 For example, two Watts-Strogatz models with parameters of two and four
 neighbours could appear totally unrelated.
 The correlation matrix is simple, however; it can be seen as an adjacency
 matrix tallied up by degree and normalised.

, again reasoning that we don't need to compare our networks to configuration
 models when we're comparing them to many other networks.
 With regards to our criteria, similar graphs will clearly have little differenc
e between them as they will have similar graphlet profiles.
 However, graphlet profiles do not consider the global topology of networks—for
 example, a network with a single connected component could potentially
 appear the same as a network with many disconnected components—so dissimilar
 networks might not appear far apart.
 Whether this is a problem in practice remains to be seen.
 Graphlet profiles are somewhat arbitrarily constructed as they have a couple
 of parameters: the size of the graphlets and the way that they are normalised.
 They are clearly simpler than some other network metrics such as betweenness
 centrality, however.

 We explore each feature described in the previous chapter in turn.
 We demonstrate the usage of our technique in distinguishing synthetic networks,

 piecewise static networks and assessing network damage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we consider only unweighted, undirected and uncoloured networks,
 with no multi-edges or self-loops.
 All networks we consider are converted to this form before any further
 processing is carried out; directed edges are replaced with undirected
 ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The features considered can clearly all be applied to directed and undirected
 networks simultaneously, but we believe this is unsound.
 In an directed network, 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i\leftarrow j}=0$
\end_inset

 does not have the same implications as in an undirected network where 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i\leftarrow j}=0\iff a_{j\leftarrow i}=0$
\end_inset

; the absence of an entry in an adjacency or Laplacian matrix means a very
 different thing.
 In practice, we found that PCA immediately separated the directed and undirecte
d networks and lost all nuance within directed and undirected networks,
 which we do not show for brevity.
 To compare the two kinds of networks meaningfully while preserving directedness
 would require substantially more research and thought than we have had
 time for.
 It is a matter of regret that we thereby contribute to the general neglect
 directed graphs face in network science

We only consider two types of real-world network as the figures became too
 hard to interpret when there were too many types of network displayed at
 once.
 This problem could be solved with creating interactive plots where metadata
 could be displayed about the networks as one hovered over them.
 Additionally, due to the fact that the adjacency and Laplacian networks
 can only compare networks with the same number of nodes, the real-world
 networks are left out for these as they are not all the same size.

 The Laplacian matrices show a greater separation than the adjacency matrices.
 Both figures show that there is a clear separation between the scale-free
 graphs on one side and the small-world and random graphs on the other.

, one can observe that as Watts-Strogatz models have their wiring probability
 increased, they become less like the Erdős-Rényi random graphs, which is
 quite counter-intuitive.
 One would expect as more randomness was added to a nearest-neighbour graph
 that it would become more like a random graph.
 This warrants further investigation, so we will now examine the principal
 components in detail.

 This transformation improves legibility around zero, aiding interpretation.

The first component of the adjacency matrix, shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:adj-components"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, has positive elements for nodes of higher degree linking to nodes of all
 degrees, and negative elements for nodes of lower degree linking to nodes
 of lower degree; i.e.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

it looks like the adjacency matrix of a scale-free network.
 This explains why the scale-free network is on the right hand side of figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Adjacency-matrix"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 In figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Adjacency-matrix"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, there is no discernible pattern along the second principal component.
 It is therefore unsurprising that when one inspects the second component
 in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:adj-components"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, it appears to be uniformly random.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The components relating to the Laplacian matrices, shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:lap-components"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, seem to be composed from the components given for the adjacency matrices
 with the addition of a diagonal, as one might expect given the definition
 of the Laplacian matrix.
 What is unexpected is that the first component seems to have had its adjacency
 matrix negated but without any effect on where the scale-free networks
 lie in the projected space.
 The diagonals are interesting and are understood more readily from figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:lap-components-diags"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

: the first component's diagonal suggests that the first moment of the degree
 of the network is tightly centred on the highest degree nodes; i.e.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

they are scale-free networks, with a smooth negative region for the rest
 of the nodes.
 The diagonal of the second component is quite pronounced: it has discrete
 steps where degree strength falls at around 50, 200 and 350 nodes, before
 it peaks sharply in the positive direction around node 500.
 If we take the negative direction of this, it represents a degree distribution
 where most nodes have a degree of one of four levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this, the positions of the networks can be explained: Erdős-Rényi graphs
 have a negative first component, corresponding to a smooth, fairly even
 degree distribution, and a positive second component which cancels out
 the spike at the end of the first component.
 Watts-Strogatz graphs have varying levels of a negative first component
 and the second component can become positive, which vary in tandem according
 to the rewiring probability.
 More rewiring probability leads to more distance from the Erdős-Rényi graphs.
 To understand this, one must go back to the algorithm in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Network-models"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Only a single link per node can be rewired, so a hundred-percent rewiring
 probability only corresponds to (number of nodes)
\begin_inset Formula $\cdot$
\end_inset

(number of neighbours)
\begin_inset Formula $^{-1}$
\end_inset

 edges being rewired, and these rewired edges will have half of their ends
 evenly distributed throughout the nodes.
 We therefore must have a degree distribution which is quite tightly centred
 on the original distribution (such as the one shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "fig:ws-deg-dist-mix"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), hence the large discrete steps in the second component, which the degree
 distributions of the Erdős-Rényi models (such as the one shown in figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "fig:er-deg-dist-mix"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) do not possess.
 The Watts-Strogatz graphs with a low rewiring probability will have tight
 degree distributions and so the diagonal of the Laplacian matrix will be
 a constant, which is closer to the first principal component than it is
 to the second.
 These facts all explain why the increased rewiring probability moves Watts-Stro
gatz further from Erdős-Rényi for the Laplacian matrices, which is the opposite
 to intuition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is still unclear why the plots of the adjacency matrix suggest that Erdős-Rén
yi graphs are closer to Watts-Strogatz with low rewiring probability.

) show good separation between different models.
 It illustrates clearly how, with rewiring, a Watts-Strogatz model becomes
 more like an Erdős-Rényi random graph as the rewiring probability increases
 from the bottom-right to the middle-top.
 It would be pertinent to note that this is exactly the opposite behaviour
 to that seen in figures

Figure

LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:mix-components"

 shows how the projection manages such good separation between the scale-free
 and small-world networks.
 The first principal component has negative elements for low-degree nodes
 linking to high-degree nodes—i.e.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

it is negative for the types of degree mixing matrices one would expect
 from a scale-free graph, which is why the scale-free models appear on the
 left in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Degree-correlation-matrix"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 It has positive elements for nodes of degree 4 linking to nodes of degree
 4 or 3, and some strength for nodes of degree 5 linking to nodes of degree
 5.
 This matches the parameters in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Models-considered-and"

 so the positive direction along this component therefore represents nearest-nei

The second principal component, also shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

, has a strong positive element for nodes of degree 4 linking to nodes of
 degree 4, surrounded by a

smear
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 of negative elements for, e.g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

nodes of degree 5 linking to nodes of degree 5.
 It has positive elements for nodes of low degree linking to nodes of high
 degree, with a characteristic striping going out to very high degree, signifyin
g the small numbers of nodes with high degree in scale-free networks.
 This principal component therefore does double duty: its positive end represent
s nearest-neighbour networks with no shortcuts and scale-free networks;
 its negative end represents Poisonnian degree distributions such as those
 found in Erdős-Rényi graphs or small-world graphs with a very high number
 of shortcuts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some clear limitations of this technique, however.
 It is very sensitive to the density of the small-world and Erdős-Rényi
 networks: any increase in density would move the 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

blobs
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 seen in the bottom left of the reconstructed components diagonally upwards,
 such that the projection would portray the networks as totally unrelated.
 It is less sensitive to the density of scale-free networks, however, as
 the smooth fall-off in the likelihood of higher-degree nodes linking to
 higher-degree nodes means that networks with higher average degree will
 just appear as more 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

extreme
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 versions of the less dense scale-free networks.
 Additionally, unlike the adjacency and Laplacian matrices, there is no
 requirement that the networks are the same size.

Graphlets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to use the smallest graphlet possible: the complexity of
 the graphlet enumeration algorithm we use scales with the number of unique
 subgraphs of the size of the graphlet in the graph.
 For random graphs of constant density, the number of unique subgraphs of
 size 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is approximately 
\begin_inset Formula ${E \choose n}\propto E^{n}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is the number of edges in the graph.
 We therefore tested a few sizes of graphlet and chose the one which struck
 the best balance between computation time and discriminatory power.

 the different graphs and seems to be totally linear with no second principal

%.
 All of the others are hard to distinguish with many networks totally obscured
 by others.
 This is because an uncoloured 3-graphlet profile is a proxy for the global
 clustering co-efficient: it simply measures the percentages of paths of
 length 3 which are closed and open.
 It is therefore unsurprising that it is one-dimensional.
 It is interesting to note that the Suffragette network appears to have
 a very different clustering coefficient to all of the other graphs.

 It is a surprise that the degree correlation matrix performed so badly,
 as our configuration models only impose the constraint that the degree
 sequence is retained; all edges are otherwise assigned at random, so one
 would expect the correlations to be lost.
 Presumably the homogeneity of the Watts-Strogatz model has ensured that
 the degree correlations are preserved.
 It could be fruitful to run this on more models, particularly more heterogeneou
s ones, and their configuration models and extract the principal components.

 Furthermore, its use in displaying the damage done to a network was demonstrate

 This work is all novel; the closest previous work had only considered data

There is an obvious criticism of much of this chapter: there is no quantitative
 comparison of our technique with existing metrics.
 In the absence of a more thorough study, we can compare our plots with
 the plots made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bounova_overview_2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Our technique seems to show a similar level of separation between networks
 as the best metrics and decompositions in their work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, comparison with other attempts at characterising networks in the
 literature is only a small part of the story.
 Complex networks are only of interest because of the systems they represent.
 Therefore the true test of any metric that describes how different networks
 are should consider how different the dynamics those networks support is
 and a measure of the amount of damage done to a network (as discussed in
 section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:network-damage"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) should be a measure of how much damage is done to the underlying node
 dynamics; this would be a fascinating avenue to explore for further work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A further limitation of this technique is that because it relies so heavily
 on the variance in the data, it can be rendered useless by outliers in
 the data.
 This was shown by the fact that when we compared undirected and directed
 networks, that difference was found at the expense of all others.
 It was also shown in other testing where we neglected to first remove self-loop
s from our real world networks and, once again, that became the only difference
 that was noticeable.
 A related risk is that if one is interested in a characteristic that isn't
 associated with a great deal of variance in the topology, the technique
 is of limited use, as was shown in the stark contrast between the usefulness
 and interpretability of the results in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Characterisation-of-ego-networks"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, where all we could say is that 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

there's some variation
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

this particular author's graphlet profile changes a lot over time
\begin_inset Quotes xrd

, compared to section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, where we showed that the 4.3b graphlet is correlated with career length
 after controlling for centralities, in the previous chapter.
 It would also be desirable to thoroughly test our techniques on directed
 networks, especially the data matrices formed from graphlet profiles, as
 direction greatly increases the total number of possible graphlets.
 Recent work has found that food webs fall neatly into categories when clustered
 based on directed graphlet profile

Our selection of graph models and real-world networks could also be improved.
 Recent work has suggested that many real-world networks are not as close
 to scale-free networks as once thought 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Our technique could potentially inform this debate given enough real-world
 networks and competing models with approximately scale-free nature; the
 real-world networks should simply appear closest to their closest models
 in the projected space.

 published some related work after this work was conducted.
 Their approach is similar to ours; they form high dimensional descriptions
 of networks from characterising nodes and then apply a dimension reduction
 (specifically, multi-dimensional scaling) to see how networks are similar
 or dissimilar.
 The authors test their metric on automorphism groups, ensuring that their
 metric returns zero for distances within the group, which is a sound way
 of testing network characterisation.
 Our reduced Laplacian and adjacency network data matrices should return
 near zero for this test, since they cannot tell the difference between
 models and their configuration models, but we cannot be certain without
 testing.
 The degree mixing matrices and graphlet profiles, however, are clearly
 invariant within automorphism groups so we can be certain that these data
 matrices would pass this test.
\end_layout

It would also be of interest to apply other dimension reductions and machine
 learning techniques to our data matrices.

 computationally efficient, making it possible to analyse larger adjacency
 and Laplacian matrices than was possible at the time this work was conducted.
 Additionally, these

\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 dimension reductions are far less susceptible to outliers than variance-based
 dimension reductions such as PCA, so we could see better distinction between
 networks which are similar.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "torres2019non"

 have applied UMAP to networks through a data matrix constructed from a
 novel graph representation.
 It should be noted that many of these competing dimension reductions are
 not invertible transformations; i.e.
\begin_inset space ~

one cannot map back to the original space from the reduced space.
 This greatly harms their interpretability; figures such as figure

In the next part, we apply a related technique—tensor decomposition—to discover
 and characterise communities in networks.
 There, each tensor represents a single network whereas in this chapter
 each matrix represented an ensemble of networks; this change in approach
 (previously pursued by other authors) is what allows us to characterise
 communities rather than whole networks.

 As was explored in section

 Here, we focus on using the decomposition techniques to detect communities
 in temporal networks and then calculate membership and relative activity
 of those communities over time.
 We decompose adjacency tensors, as introduced in section

, relating to single networks

 rather than data matrices relating to multiple networks.
 In this way we find similarities within rather than across networks.
 This approach gives us more detail about the behaviour within each network—comp
are this with the previous part where we distilled networks down to a single
 point—and is often easier to interpret.
 A clear example of this is in our novel application of the technique to
 software dependency networks in chapter

 As is explored in section

\end_inset

, we reason that if multiple tensor decompositions arrive at similar clusterings
—i.e.
 partitions of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

 which are approximately the same—despite the stochastic nature of the decomposi
tion algorithms, those clusterings are likely to be the right ones.
 We therefore turned to another metric for evaluating clustering methods:
 adjusted mutual information, a measure of the level of agreement between
 clusterings.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Measuring the level of agreement between clusterings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adjusted mutual information is a measure of the level of agreement between
 two sets of clusterings, independent of cluster labels.
 If the two clusterings split the elements into the same subsets, it is
 maximal; if the two clusterings have the same level of overlap between
 their subsets as if they had been partitioned randomly, it is 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More rigorously, the adjusted mutual information (AMI) between two partitions
 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $U=\{U_{1},U_{2},\ldots\}$
\end_inset

 is a finite-length partition of some set of length 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is another finite partition of that set, is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{AMI}(U,V)=\frac{I(U;V)-E[I(U;V)]}{\text{max}(S(U),S(V))-E[I(U;V)]}\text{,}
\]

\end_inset

where the entropy 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

S(U)=-\sum_{i}\frac{|U_{i}|}{N}\text{log}\frac{|U_{i}|}{N}\text{,}
\]

with 
\begin_inset Formula $0\text{\ensuremath{\cdot}log}(0)=0$

\end_inset

 is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
I(U;V)=\sum_{i=1}^{|U|}\sum_{j=1}^{|V|}\frac{|U_{i}\cap V_{j}|}{N}\log\frac{N|U_{i}\cap V_{j}|}{|U_{i}||V_{j}|}\text{,}

and 
\begin_inset Formula $E[W]$

 which we omit for brevity.
 AMI measures the amount of agreement between two clusterings.
 It has an upper bound of 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

.
 An AMI score of 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the amount of agreement one would expect if one of the clusterin
gs was totally random and 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 corresponds to perfect agreement between the two sets of clusters.
 The AMI score can be negative if there is more disagreement between the
 clusters than one would expect from random chance.
 It is hard to interpret the meaning of scores between 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, but it is important to bear in mind that anything greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 is a good score in the sense that it is better than random guessing.
 AMI is quite sensitive to the number of clusters and awards higher scores
 to pairs of clusterings that agree on the same number of assignments but
 have a larger number of clusters, to the limit where if each element is
 given its own cluster the AMI must be 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Subsection
Application of AMI to choosing the number of components in tensor decompositions
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:AMIforDecomps"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first task is to consider which values of 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 to test.
 Generally in this work, we don't have any knowledge as to the likely number
 of communities.
 We therefore start with two, since 
\begin_inset Formula $R=1$
\end_inset

 will always give a maximal AMI.
 We run the decomposition multiple times for each likely 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 to determine whether the decomposition is stable, that is, if multiple
 runs produce the same results.
 As with many experiments, the exact number of runs required will depend
 on the exact application: as the number of runs increases the standard
 error of the mean pairwise AMI will reduce.
 This makes it easier to determine with more certainty where there is a
 peak in AMI.
 In our experiments, we found that thirty repeats were sufficient.
 We reason that a good choice of the number of communities to decompose
 a tensor into should result in the tensor decomposition algorithms choosing
 roughly the same nodes to assign to each community as this implies that
 true communities are not being artificially split up.
 That would result in nodes being assigned fairly randomly to each of the
 communities a true community was split into and so would not result in
 what we term a stable decomposition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We look to see if nodes appear in the same communities as each other by
 considering the mean pairwise adjusted mutual information between repeated
 runs for a single 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 We use hard clustering for this process by assigning nodes to communities
 for each non-temporal factor from the maximum strength, i.e.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

for a single-layer temporal network, 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Community}(i,\boldsymbol{v})=\text{argmax}(v_{ir})$
\end_inset

, for each factor matrix in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "eq:tensordecomp"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 For many applications it is clear which factor to prioritise; for a single-laye
red temporal network with a scale-free out-degree distribution but a normal
 in-degree distribution, such as the software dependency networks considered
 in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Software"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, it is probably best to consider communities based on the factor corresponding
 to the in-degree distribution, as the out-degree factor will be very sparse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Since we are using AMI to compare clusterings with each other and have far
 fewer clusters (or communities) than nodes, we believe the interpretability
 of the absolute value of the AMI is not particularly important.
 We are concerned primarily with the relative changes in AMI as we move
 from one number of communities to another; a peak in AMI with respect to
 the number of communities means that that number of communities is more
 stable and is therefore more likely to be an optimal number of communities.
 We therefore plot AMI against 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 and look for the point with a negative second derivative—the second local
 maxima—to guard against the initial advantage that very low numbers of
 communities have with AMI.
 Rather than an an 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

elbow
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 in the plot of AMI versus the number of communities, we therefore look
 for the second maxima in a graph that looks like a

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Subjective checks
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Eyeballing-it"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can check visually to see if the temporal activity of communities looks
 similar across multiple decompositions into a single number of communities.
 If the decomposition is unstable, i.e.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

if multiple runs produce wildly different results, it suggests that ground-truth
 communities are being merged or split up.
 Another check that can be performed is to look at the metadata associated
 with nodes from each community, making a qualitative judgement as to whether
 nodes in a single community are similar.
 For example, if a numerical computing software package and a front-end
 web development software package are in the same community in a software
 dependency network, the number of communities is probably too small.
 A final check is whether adding an extra component adds interesting new
 behaviour to the temporal community activity, or if it instead seems to
 break an existing community into noisy subcommunities.
 All of these approaches are quite subjective, so there is quite a large
 uncertainty in exactly how many communities is ideal for any application.
 This is not a major issue as we are not particularly interested in the
 exact number of communities our applications have; indeed, we do not believe
 this is a meaningful question as there are no 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

ground truth
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 communities, i.e.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

communities which have some real basis, for example, the classes children
 are assigned to at school.
 We are interested in the activity over time of communities and the membership
 of these communities—it does not matter a great deal if two communities
 are seen as erroneously one in our analysis.

In this chapter we have explored a method for determining a locally optimal
 number of communities,

 In the next chapter, we apply this technique to analyse temporal collaboration
 networks: software dependency networks corresponding to several languages.

, is used in this chapter to explore the dynamics of communities of software
 and then compare these dynamics between languages on a dataset of approximately
 1 million software projects.
 We establish that adjusted mutual information is a valid metric by which
 to assess the number of communities in a tensor decomposition and find
 that there are striking differences between the communities found across
 different software ecosystems and that communities do experience large
 and interpretable changes in activity over time.
 The differences between the elm and R software ecosystems, which see some
 communities decline over time and the more conventional software ecosystems
 of Python, Java and JavaScript, which do not see many declining communities,
 are particularly marked.

 network of Apache Ant.
 This is a single piece of software in which the classes are more witting
 participants in the software than in general software dependency networks
 where the authors of a package may have no idea where their work is being
 used.
 Additionally, the community detection methods used are static, so it is
 the metrics on the types of communities found at each version of Apache
 Ant which are compared rather than the qualities of any individual communities
 being tracked across time.

By answering these questions, we identify communities of packages in the
 ecosystems of several languages.
 Namely: Elm; JavaScript; Rust; Python; R; and Java.
 These languages were chosen because data on their package ecosystems are
 readily available and they represent a variety of uses and ages: low-level
 systems languages; scientific computing; and web development; with histories
 between 3 and 20 years long.

\begin_layout Standard
Software packages associated with a single programming language and package
 manager form an 
\emph on
ecosystem
\emph default
 and a 
\emph on
community
\emph default
 is a collection of packages which are more likely to depend on one another
 than depend on packages from outside that community.
 Communities may be related by some theme and by co-occurrence of activity
 over time.
 They might be collections of numerical computing packages, or a community
 of packages that use a particular library, or a community of older packages
 that became obsolete.
 Packages may be in more than one community, which is modelled by vectors
 of continuous strengths of membership to each community as detailed in

Shape of the data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We considered the following package managers (corresponding to specific
 languages): elm-get (Elm), npm (JavaScript), crates.io (Rust), PyPI (Python),
 CRAN (R) and Maven (Java).
 All publicly registered packages for these package managers were included
 in our analysis.
 To simplify our analysis, we do not consider specific versions of dependent
 packages—each package depends on some other packages at each time, each
 of which is assumed to be the most up-to-date package available at that
 time.
 We only consider packages registered with these package managers and do
 not consider cross-platform (inter-language) dependencies.
 The data cover 1 million projects listed in package managers.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Brief introduction to each ecosystem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we will briefly introduce each language and ecosystem considered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Elm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "elm-lang.org"
target "https://elm-lang.org/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) is a relatively small new language created in 2012 as a functional language
 for developing web applications.
 It is unusually focused on a single domain and unusually restrictive in
 what can be expressed in listed packages.
 The language authors explicitly discourage proliferation of packages in
 favour of a unified and carefully designed standard package for each task.
 It aims to eliminate run-time errors and many classes of logical errors
 through static analysis and careful language design.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Python
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
is a very popular general-purpose interpreted programming language.
 It was first released in 1991.
 Its package manager, PyPI (
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "https://pypi.org/"
target "pypi.org"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), was released in 2002.
 Python is notable for having a large standard library; many features such
 as HTTP and GUI support that would be external packages in other languages
 are included by default.
 We therefore suspect that Python's package ecosystem will look quite different
 to many of the other languages we consider.
 It is perhaps pertinent to note that some of the packages listed in PyPI
 are designed to be used by end-users, not developers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
JavaScript
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
is another popular general-purpose interpreted programming language.
 It was first released in 1995 as part of the Netscape browser and was initially
 used for client-side scripts on web pages, but now has several server-side
 implementations, most notably Node.js.
 JavaScript has a very small standard library, with the exception of the
 DOM interface (Document Object Model—a representation of a web page), which
 is included.
 We therefore expect most JavaScript packages to have to depend on many
 other packages.
 JavaScript's most common package manager is npm (
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "npmjs.com"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), the Node.js package manager, which was released in 2010.
 The JavaScript ecosystem we describe in this paper is the public npm registry,
 which is the 
\shape italic
de facto
\shape default
 canonical list of JavaScript packages.
 Despite its name, the registry is used for all types of JavaScript, not
 just server-side applications.
 Like PyPI, some of the packages listed in npm are designed to be used by
 end-users, not developers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Rust
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
is another relatively new systems programming language.
 Unlike many of the other ecosystems we have considered, it is statically
 compiled.
 One of its main aims is safe concurrent programming.
 We suspect that because of this conservative focus, packages written in
 Rust will have relatively few dependencies.
 Rust's package manager is Cargo, which was released in 2014 and its registry
 is 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "crates.io"
target "https://crates.io/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Like PyPI, some of the packages listed on crates.io are designed to be used
 by end-users, not developers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
R
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
is an interpreted programming language for statistical computing.
 It was first released in 1993.
 Its standard library for statistical computing is large.
 Its package manager is the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "cran.r-project.org"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Java
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
is a general-purpose typed compiled programming language, first released
 in 1995.
 Its standard library is large.
 Java has no official package manager, but the most widely used is Apache
 Maven (
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "maven.apache.org"
target "https://maven.apache.org/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), which was released in 2004.

\begin_layout Subsection

\begin_layout Standard

, where each 
\begin_inset Formula

\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
denotes whether the package 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 depends on the package 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 We consider links as going from 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, so the direction of each link reflects the flow of code.
 Software packages have unweighted directed links to packages that they
 depend on at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 according to the most recently available version of the software package
 at that time.
 The time is quantised into time-steps.
 We chose a resolution of one month on the basis that packages are long-lived
 and change dependencies rarely; we looked at other resolutions but they
 didn't qualitatively change our results.

\begin_layout Standard
Each

\begin_inset Formula $r$

 The total number of communities or components, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$

, is a fixed chosen parameter.
 Each 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{a}_{nr}$
\end_inset

 for a specific 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 The concept of a temporal index having strengths of community membership
 may seem odd; it is perhaps more easily understood as the amount of community
 activity at a certain time

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{t}$

 respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will now describe 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 in more detail.
 We will use two facts about software dependency networks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the number of outgoing links from each package (number of packages that
 depend on a package) follows a power-law; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the number of incoming links to each package (number of packages that a
 package depends on) is fairly evenly distributed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 represents groups of nodes which are linked to by similar nodes, it is
 very sparse with only a few hub nodes having any community membership due
 to high strengths in 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 is much more evenly distributed as it represents groups of nodes which
 link to similar nodes; most packages are strongly associated with at least
 one community.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a community has significantly declined from its peak according to a plot
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\tau}_{r}$

 shape across all software ecosystems considered; broadly, all out-degree
 distributions follow a power-law and the in-degree distributions follow
 more Poisonnian distributions.
 Respectively, this means that a few packages are depended on by most packages,
 and that packages have similar numbers of dependencies within ecosystems.

Npm, the JavaScript ecosystem, in an outlier here.
 Its in-degree distribution is bimodal: there are more packages with the
 highest numbers of dependencies than there are with middling numbers of
 dependencies.
 Upon further investigation, it became apparent that the distribution is
 skewed by a few hundred joke/malicious packages

\family typewriter
evancz/html
\family default
 is the precursor of 
\family typewriter
elm-lang/html
\family default
 and we can see an early community of packages using 
\family typewriter
evancz/html
\family default
 that decays over time as the newer community using 
\family typewriter
elm-lang/html
\family default
 emerges.
 We can also see the swift rise of a community of HTTP-using packages.
 This is perhaps particularly pronounced in Elm because the language is
 unusually restrictive (there was no official way to write HTTP packages
 before the package which became 
\family typewriter
elm-lang/http
\family default
) and young (there was a strong known demand for an obvious feature like
 HTTP support).
 In a more mature language, one might expect that the rise and fall of communiti
es would be less extreme.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fall in activity of the 
\family typewriter

 Those that do make the jump appear in the

 New packages generally do not depend on them, nor depend on packages that

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Elm is a young and deliberately unconventional and experimental language,
 so it is to be expected that many packages will be abandoned as the community
 experiments with different approaches.

\family typewriter

.
 
\family typewriter
rustc-serialize

 The decline in activity of the

winapi
\family default
 is also easily interpretable.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 factor for this community is bimodal and the size of the higher strength
 cluster indicates that there are around 450 packages in this community.
 A brief review of these packages suggests that they are low-level cross-platfor
m packages for interacting with the operating system.
 These packages were amongst the first written and predate the package manager,
 which explains their steep initial rise.

, AMI suggests that decomposition into seven or eight communities is acceptable
 as this is where the peak is located.
 That CRAN can be stably decomposed into two communities suggests that the

 that when decomposed into seven communities, distinctive waves of activity
 over time exist.
 We believe these waves are driven by CRAN's rolling release model which
 requires packages to be actively maintained or de-listed.
 This is a strong incentive for package authors to switch dependencies if
 e.g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

one of two testing libraries is actively maintained.
 The de-listing also means that older, unused packages are removed from
 the dependency graph over time, unlike any of the other studied ecosystems.

 We have chosen the smallest good number except when that number was two.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We observed interesting differences between ecosystems in this metric: Elm
 and R have relatively high AMIs at relatively low numbers of components
 while other languages such as JavaScript had low AMIs for all of the numbers
 of components we tried, suggesting that a more representative number of
 components might be much higher.
 This tells us something about the diversity of an ecosystem: the more communiti
es it has, the more diverse it must be, suggesting that R and Elm are less
 diverse than the other language considered.
 This matches up neatly with our domain knowledge that Elm is almost exclusively
 used for creating websites and R for performing statistical analysis, whereas
 the other languages are much more general purpose.

The labels are reasonably stable across decompositions when AMI is high
 and they appear to be informative in most ecosystems.
 The relative size and activity over time of the communities can often be
 matched with what we know about the their constituent packages and the
 ecosystem from other sources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The community activity plots show clear differences between the various
 ecosystems.
 Elm, R and Rust all contain communities that decline in activity over time.
 Some languages such as Elm, R and Rust have

 community activity where packages have been replaced by others.
 Java, Python and JavaScript do not exhibit such behaviour; suggesting that
 their communities are more stable—their composition does not change much
 over time in terms of nodes or links between those nodes.

Community composition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing ecosystems, we observe that Python has communities centred around
 making websites (
\family typewriter
django
\family default
), scientific computing (
\family typewriter
numpy
\family default
), or interpreting configuration files (
\family typewriter
pyyaml
\family default
).
 By contrast, Elm's communities are all to do with building web applications
 and R's communities are mostly focused towards scientific computing.
 This suggests, uncontroversially, that Elm and R are less general purpose
 languages, as their communities are full of packages doing similar things,
 than Python, where the communities do very different things.

Conclusions
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Conclusions"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have found a large amount of variation between different software ecosystems;
 some, such as Python, are stable and long-lived and others, such as Elm,
 have packages that have been important but short-lived due to deprecation.
 It is our suspicion that a large amount of the variation between languages
 is due to the size and usefulness of their standard libraries.
 However, some of the differences, especially those found by the tensor
 decompositions, could be because early communities which fall out of use
 are ignored by the decomposition in favour of later, larger communities.
 It would be interesting to investigate whether this effect is real.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on our analysis, we have the following answers to our research questions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $RQ_{1}$
\end_inset

 What are the differences between different software ecosystems? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are differences in the number of communities of software packages,
 the rate at which communities of software packages gain and lose popularity
 as measured by how often they are dependant on each other and in the overall
 trajectory of the growth of these communities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $RQ_{2}$
\end_inset

 What do communities of commonly-used-together software packages look like?
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to the languages as a whole, the communities have fairly homogeneous
 in-degree distributions but heterogeneous power-law out-degree distributions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $RQ_{3}$
\end_inset

 How do these communities change with time? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general rule is 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

up and to the right
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

: all of the ecosystems we considered increased in activity as time went
 on, in agreement with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Decan2018h"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This is unsurprising as it is relatively rare for a package to lose dependencie
s—it can fall out of contemporary use in that new packages will not choose
 to depend on it, but the packages that previously depended on it will tend
 to continue to depend on it as rewriting them to use alternative packages
 often requires significant effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our results agree with that found in other works, especially that of

\begin_layout Standard
The absolute level of the adjusted mutual information at low numbers of
 communities seems to reflect the diversity of an ecosystem: R and elm,
 both domain specific languages, have high levels of AMI for 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

, whereas all of the general purpose languages we consider do not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Methodologically, we found that using adjusted mutual information as a metric
 by which to choose the number of communities led to (predominantly) explainable
 communities that appeared to be stable across multiple runs of the decompositio
ns and across multiple values of the number of communities chosen.
 Our labelling algorithm, equation
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eqn:labelling"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 worked well for our application, giving plausible and comprehensible labels
 and could plausibly work well for any communities in networks with power-law
 degree distributions.
 The stability of an ecosystem can be seen from our activity over time plots,
 i.e.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

the 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\tau}_{r}$
\end_inset

 vectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further work could involve investigating larger components for languages
 for which we currently have fairly low AMI scores.
 It would also be fairly straight-forward to extend our technique to consider
 the co-authorship network that creates the software as another layer in
 the network.
 Knowledge of how the ecosystem evolves organically could be used to detect
 fraudulent packages, especially by unknown authors.
 The creation of models of software ecosystem evolution from simple sets
 of rules (for example, 10% of packages are deprecated every 6 months) to
 try to replicate our results synthetically could also prove insightful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our work could have applications in helping designers of software ecosystems
 to make informed choices; it is clear that, for example, CRAN's rolling
 release policy has a big impact on its software communities.
 One could imagine using clusterings like those we have created to determine
 whether part of a software ecosystem was on the wane and was likely to
 be replaced soon.
 Such considerations would make sense if one was choosing dependencies for
 a project that was intended to last many years.
 Additionally, if one knows how communities form naturally, it becomes easier
 to pick out outliers, as we have seen with the npm

 packages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, we have described the long term evolution of several software
 ecosystems by breaking them up into their constituent communities.
 We have been able to spot ground-truth events such as the deprecation of
 major software packages in the temporal activities of these communities.
 We have demonstrated striking differences between different software ecosystems
, particularly with the rolling release cycle of R.
 Previous work has not had as much success highlighting these differences;
 we have demonstrated the use of applying state-of-the-art network science
 techniques for analysing software dependency networks.

, the English language has evolved in a fitful manner; its growth rate has
 been far from constant with many periods in which expansion was above historica
l norms.
 This chapter hopes to explore the causes of these expansions by identifying
 groups of words which appeared in the language at around the same time.
 We note that naive approaches, such as splitting the language up into regions,
 do not give a satisfactory answer except, perhaps, for the last 200 years
 which may have been driven by colonisation, as may be seen in figure

We hope to be able to see the rise and fall of terminology related to specific
 fields, such as those used in sailing, the automotive industry and computing;
 we also hope to see changes from exposure to foreign influence, such as
 the Columbian exchange.
 This work has the potential to improve our understanding of how groups
 of words enter and leave the English language and how the rate at which
 that evolution occurs has changed over time.

We define near-synonymy as any words no more than one level above or below

 that things like adverbs and adjectives with the same root (e.g

 temporal communities of words.
 We decompose the the network such that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{ijt}\approx\sum_{r=1}^{r=R}\kappa_{ir}\kappa_{jr}\tau_{tr}\text{,}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $K=[\kappa_{ir}]$
\end_inset

 signifies strength of lemma membership to communities and 
\begin_inset Formula $T=[\tau_{tr}]$
\end_inset

 gives the temporal activity of the communities.
 Note that here, unlike chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, we only have two distinct factors rather than three as the network is

 However, because lemmas with the strongest memberships are those with the
 most synonyms, they may not necessarily be very well known.
 To aid the ease of interpretation we therefore take the top 10 lemmas with
 the strongest memberships to each community and sort them in order of decreasin
g number of quotations listed in the

prefix "OED"

\end_inset

OED, which we use as a crude proxy for how common words are.
 We found that naming each community by the top three names in these lists
 was sufficient for us to distinguish between homonyms, i.e.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

words with different meanings which are spelt the same, bypass uncommon
 words and get some idea what the community represented.

\begin_layout Standard
We found that all choices for the numbers of communities between two and
 fifty produced very noisy activity plots.
 This was unexpected, but it could be because the network is split into
 so many disconnected components.
 We therefore did not perform the analysis from chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Locally-optimal-numbers"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 of the optimum number of communities as there was clearly something wrong
 with our approach.
 We discuss possibilities for other approaches in the next section, but
 we did not have time to perform any of them in time for inclusion in this
 work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, we noticed that with a moving arithmetic average corresponding
 to 15 time intervals, i.e.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

150 years, some pattern emerged.
 We present this smoothed temporal activity for the decomposition with in
 figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 There is some promise here: words in the same community appear to be related,
 with perhaps the exception of the 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

farther, absinth, flea-dock
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 community.
 It is not clear whether the temporal activities have any bearing in reality;
 cross-referencing with Google Ngrams it is clear that 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

mickle
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

, for example, has been in declining usage, but 
\begin_inset Quotes xld

\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes xld

\begin_inset Quotes xrd

 have been flat and it is not clear that words relating to 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

more
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 have dropped out of the language in the last hundred years or so—although
 it is quite possible that they have and that this author is just unaware
 of it.
 A more thorough study would be required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, many of the communities are centred around flowers (
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

argrimony, water lily, woodruff
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

) or insults (
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

dully, sap-headed, thickheadedness
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

) which may point to a fatal flaw in our analysis: we heavily rely on the
 number of synonyms a word has—words are given community strengths based
 on whether they are synonymous with the same words and whether their links
 appear at the same time.
 This appears to be a poor approach as the number of synonyms appears to
 be skewed in favour of plants, for which there are many scientific and
 common names for similar plants which the OED classes as synonyms, and
 insults.
 Our desire to spot the rise of new technologies and cultural exchange has
 gone unmet.

\begin_layout Standard
The OED has a hierarchical thesaurus where words are linked to categories,
 and categories are linked to parent categories in a hierarchical fashion;
 e.g.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

cat
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes xld

\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 category which itself belongs to the 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

family Felidae (feline)
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 category.
 We can present this as multi-layer temporal directed network with adjacency
 tensor
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{i\leftarrow j}^{\alpha t}=\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if node }i\text{ is linked to node }j\text{ at time }t\text{ in layer }\alpha\\
0 & \text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

where all other symbols retain their previous meaning and

\end_layout

\end_inset

 denotes specify the type of relationship between two nodes.
 The hierarchical layer could be organised such that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{i\leftarrow j}^{\text{hierarchical, }t}=\chi_{i}(t)\cdot\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if node }i\text{ is a child of node }j\text{ in the OED hierarchical thesaurus}\\
0 & \text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\chi_{i}(t)=\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if node }i\text{ is a lemma node or it has a path to one at time }t\\
0 & \text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

a recursive definition which can be resolved by iterating up from the lemmas.
 We hope that this representation may prove more fruitful than the previous
 one as it relies less on synonymy and puts more weight on hierarchy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another possibility is to attempt to vary link strengths based on the rarity
 of words at each time interval; links in the hierarchy layer could have
 weights according to the mean rarity of all of their children and links
 in the synonymy layer could have links with weights based on the minimum
 rarity of the two nodes to which they are attached.
 The OED has some static data on rarity but it is not currently in the dataset
 we possess.
 There are detailed data on the frequency of words written in printed books
 over time for approximately the last two hundred years available from Google
 Ngrams, but these do not account for homonymy.

 thesis, we have shown the value of characterisation at many different scales
 in networks.
 This final part will try to wrap up our work and suggest future avenues
 we or others might take.
 Here, we provide a recapitulation, highlighting some of our key findings,
 and explore areas where we think improvements could be made.
 This chapter is split into four sections: one for each of the three main
 parts of the thesis and a final section presenting our overall conclusions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Node characterisation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our first area of contribution in the thesis was in node characterisation.
 Building on previous work that had shown that the use of ego-networks
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ego-network
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to characterise nodes was a promising technique, we demonstrated the benefits
 of considering where the ego
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ego
\end_layout

\end_inset

 lay in these networks through the use of colour
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
graph colour
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In an academic co-authorship network, we found that the proportion of coloured
 graphlets of a certain kind—a star centred on the ego with 3 links to alters—we
re the second strongest predictors of career length of all the topological
 measures we tried, and that there were no statistically significant links
 between monochromatic graphlets and career length.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is an obvious criticism here in that we did not include other real-world
 properties of the authors which could have confounded our analysis.
 Unfortunately, the disambiguated network we use did not contain that informatio
n and the authors were irreversibly anonymous.
 It would be interesting to see if the result held if 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

total papers published
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 was also included in our analysis; to our eyes the 4.3b graphlet, shown
 again in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:4.3bfinale"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, looks suspiciously like it could simply be a proxy for the number of papers
 published as it is the graphlet which requires the most papers published
 (if there was a link between any of the alters, that would reduce the number
 of papers published).
 The topology only explains a small fraction of research career length,
 so academic career length isn't solely determined by the topology of the
 co-authorship network, which is to be expected.

Network characterisation

\begin_layout Standard
We have shown that so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes xld

 descriptions of networks can be used as an input to matrix decompositions
 of networks to highlight similarities and differences to them.
 We provided some indications that these

 inputs were about as good as

 ones but did not test it very rigorously.
 We showed that our technique can successfully distinguish between configuration
 models and original networks.
 An example of using the technique to track network damage was given.
 The similarities and dissimilarities between some real-world networks and
 synthetic networks were shown, repeated here in figure

We built on our work in the first part and again showed that coloured graphlets

 The figures relating to the academic co-authorship network

 are hard to interpret.
 We suspect this is because, as was found in the first part, the topology
 only accounts for a small amount of variation in career length and career
 length is hardly the only variable describing academic researchers.
 An interactive version of the plot, where one could hover over outliers
 and see who they were, could be interesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Community characterisation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous part, we explored the use of tensor decomposition to characteris
e communities in large, real-world temporal networks.
 We found that existing techniques for determining sensible numbers of communiti
es to decompose these networks into were not suited to the networks we considere
d and devised a novel one.
 This technique uses adjusted mutual information to determine which numbers
 of communities lead to the formation of similar communities on repeated
 runs, with the logic that if an optimising method with random elements
 finds similar communities each time, then these are plausible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We applied this technique to several software dependency networks
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 and found we could see interesting real-world behaviour reflected in the
 activity of these communities.
 Particularly, we could see the deprecation of packages and their effect
 on the network and we could observe how some of the rules governing some
 software dependency ecosystems shaped the activity of their communities
 over time, with the rolling-release cycle of R especially well-reflected,

We also demonstrated how this technique could be applied to semantic networks:
 we investigated how we would go about applying it to study the evolution
 of the English language.
 We hoped we would be able to see the impact of new technologies and societal
 change in the language but our results so far have been hard to interpret.
 We have provided suggestions for how we might proceed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have made contributions at three scales of characterisation: node (local),
 community (mid-range) and whole network (global).
 Our exploration of graphlet profiles to characterise nodes through their
 ego-networks led us to consider how we could characterise whole networks
 through their graphlet profiles; our investigation of the use of matrix
 decomposition on graphlet profiles led neatly to the concept of tensor
 decompositions, albeit applied to networks in a totally different way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We hope that our work encourages more people to use tensor decompositions
 to analyse large real-world networks; our technique should help others
 to have the confidence to use decompositions in the knowledge that there
 are metrics by which they can evaluate their choice of the number of communitie
s.
 Regarding our applications, we believe that there are many interesting
 problems that may have more light shed on them through applying network
 science techniques to software dependency networks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We feel that we have only scratched the surface of what is possible.
 In our next and final chapter we shall enumerate some of these possibilities.

 is one example of work that has already attempted to do something similar
 by applying deep-learning techniques to networks.
 We are somewhat reluctant to go so far as our technique was able to distinguish
 well between many types of network without requiring labels.
 Indeed, we think the best way forward for our technique is to apply it
 to as many real-world networks as possible to see what sort of clusters
 emerge, if any.

Viva: this sounds wrong, but it's right: W^-1=W' as it's orthogonal (nb:

If we apply this to the principal components of adjacency matrices or Laplacian
 matrices, we can create synthetic weighted & directed networks from any
 point in the reduced space.
 We can therefore create a network

 It would be interesting to see what those look like; in the facial recognition

\begin_layout Subsection
Quantitative comparison of our work with related work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There have been several related attempts to characterise networks through
 dimension reductions

key "Costa2007,bounova_overview_2012,Ronqui2015,schieber2017quantification"

\end_inset

.
 There has not yet been an attempt to quantify the success or otherwise
 of these techniques or to compare them in a thorough manner.
 An experiment could be devised with a straightforward collection of synthetic
 and real networks from several categories.
 A clustering algorithm such as DBSCAN 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ester1996density"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 would then be run in the reduced spaces and the adjusted mutual information
 (AMI) between the clustering and the ground-truth labels could be determined.
 The dimension reduction with the highest AMI could be considered the best.

Graphlets

\begin_layout Standard
There are two main areas where we feel our work on graphlets could be extended.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Graphlet profile normalisation performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graphlets may appear in networks for uninteresting reasons: for example,
 in a denser graph, denser graphlets are likely to appear.
 We need some kind of benchmark by which we can tell how unusual a graphlet
 is.
 Most of the current approaches in the literature use the so-called z-score

: the number of standard deviations away from the mean the number of appearances

That is too slow for many purposes where one wishes to compare many hundreds
 or thousands of real networks.
 We propose a faster, approximate technique: instead generate ten random
 graphs for each decile of density and interpolate the number of graphlets
 between them and then calculate the z-scores for each graphlet in a real
 network,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
z_{i}=\frac{\mu_{i}(\rho)-x_{i}}{\sigma_{i}(\rho)},
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\mu_{i}(\rho) & =w_{-}(\rho)\overline{x_{i\rho_{-}}}-w_{+}(\rho)\overline{x_{i\rho_{+}}}\text{,}\nonumber \\
\sigma_{i}(\rho) & =w_{-}(\rho)\sigma(x_{i\rho_{-}})-w_{+}(\rho)\sigma(x_{i\rho_{+}})\text{,}\nonumber \\
w_{+}(\rho) & =\frac{\rho-\rho_{+}}{\rho_{+}-\rho_{-}}\text{,}\nonumber \\
w_{-}(\rho) & =\frac{\rho-\rho_{-}}{\rho_{+}-\rho_{-}}\text{,}\nonumber \\
x_{i} & =\frac{n_{i}+1}{(\Sigma_{j}n_{j})+\text{max}(j)}\text{,}\label{eq:ruleofsuccession}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the z-score of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{\text{th}}$
\end_inset

 graphlet which occurs 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}$
\end_inset

 times in a network of density 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{+}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{-}$
\end_inset

 are the densities of the closest ensembles of random graphs, 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{x}$
\end_inset

 is the arithmetic mean of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(x)$
\end_inset

 is its standard deviation and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i\rho_{+}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i\rho_{-}}$
\end_inset

 are sets corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 in each of the ten random graphs in the ensembles for the closest densities
 matching the graph of interest.
 A small but important detail that has not been covered by the existing
 literature is how to calculate the z-score of a graphlet that has never
 appeared in the ensemble.
 To do this, we suggest using the rule of succession 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 which leads to equation

, assuming

 that each graphlet is equally likely to appear and updating that assumption
 in the face of additional evidence.

Any research investigating this novel graphlet normalisation procedure should
 carefully consider the implications of controlling only for density where
 existing methods control for degree sequences.
 It should be noted that in the limit of a large number of networks, this
 procedure is 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 times faster than the existing procedure, where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the number of configuration models generated per graph, commonly a thousand.

\begin_layout Subsection
Academic career length from collaboration network improvements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we discussed in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Career-length-in"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the graphlet most related to career length was the star graphlet, 4.3b,
 with no links between the co-authors of the author of interest.
 This graphlet is the one which requires the highest number of papers to
 be authored.
 A clear improvement, then, would be to include the number of papers written
 alongside other characteristics such as citation count to see whether the
 graphlet is still related to career length, taking those other factors
 into account.
 However, this could all be of limited interest, as the variance in that
 graphlet can only explain approximately a year of difference in career
 length.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, the network lends itself quite naturally for analysis through
 the lens of tensor decomposition.
 An additional layer representing papers, with links between the author
 and paper layer denoting authorship and links between papers denoting citation
 could also prove interesting to analyse; one could potentially spot fields
 forming and fading away.

\begin_layout Section
Community characterisation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our analysis of software ecosystems could be deepened by adding a layer
 relating authors to the packages to which they have contributed.
 Most of these packages are developed in the open, so these contributions
 could be weighted by the number of patches applied.
 It would be particularly interesting to see what happens to authors when
 they cease contributing to one package.
 Authors often contribute to more than one language ecosystem, so another
 enhancement could be to consider all software ecosystems together to try
 to analyse how authors move between them.
 The patterns we observed, particularly the rolling-release cycle of R,
 could lend themselves to simple theoretical models of ecosystems.
 Such models could be of great interest to those creating software ecosystems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, our linguistic network could be expanded to consider multiple
 languages, with a layer for each language, where links between layers denote
 synonymy.
 One could then potentially observe the cross-pollination between languages
 which would be a fascinating endeavour.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, we feel that there is a large room for tensor decompositions
 to be applied to more data.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 provide a fascinating exploration of the evolution of the study of ecological
 networks, but they study the network as a series of piecewise static networks.
 We believe that tensor decompositions would have greater insight in cases
 such as these.

\begin_layout Standard
A further symptom of the immaturity of tensor decompositions

 are already somewhat neglected and tensor decompositions are no exception.
 Reducing the barrier to entry so that non-specialists could apply these
 dynamic community detection algorithms to their own networks could yield
 dividends in terms of the amount of output produced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, it would be beneficial if there was a theoretical basis as to the
 soundness of using adjusted mutual information to choose the number of
 components into which a tensor should be decomposed.
 Our current arguments have only really suggested that it is plausible,
 which is supported by our results.
 Further work could also consider why CORCONDIA

ing nodes for machine learning

Interplay between topology and node dynamics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have intimated in previous chapters, we believe that complex networks
 are interesting predominately because they reflect real-world networks.
 In these real-world networks, we rarely if ever care directly about the
 network topology: it is the topology's impact on the observable properties
 of the system, such as the amount of time it takes to travel from one place
 to another, or the diversity of an ecosystem, that we want to optimise.
 It is therefore crucial to link the topology to these observable properties,
 which is what we have done in chapters

 What we have not done is linked the topology to models of the dynamics
 that generate these observable properties.
 This is a very active field—see
